# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to perform analysis on Kickstarter campaign data to uncover trends in success and failure rate depending on launch date and category of campaign, specifically plays.
### Analysis and Challenges
#### Analysis
The data was analyzed to dive into Theater Outcomes by Launch Date and determine if there were any notable trends. The following chart shows this data:

The data was also analyzed to determine the outcome of campaigns based on their goal amount to raise for their project. The following chart shows this data:

#### Challenges
The biggest challenge that arose during this analysis was converting the data to a format that was easier to compare. For example, the dates were not formatted to a standard date format so they had to be converted. Also, the category and subcategory were grouped into one column so in order to dive deeper in to the subcategory, the category and subcategory needed to be separated.

### Results

#### Outcomes based on Launch Date
The analysis showed that the best time to launch a theater kickstarter campaign is May.
The analysis also showed that the worst time to launch a theater kickstarter campaign is October.

#### Outcomes based on Goals
The analysis showed that 80#% of theater kickstarter campaigns with a goal of less than $1000, were successful. 100% of campaigns with a goal of $45,000 to $49,999 were successful, although there were only 2 so there was not enough data to make a reasonable assumption based on that goal amount.

### Summary of Limitations

As discussed above, there were some goal amounts that did not have many campaigns so it limits the conclusions that can be drawn.

Some other charts and comparisons that would be useful are how the length of the campaign compared to it's success or failure and also which locations had better outcomes for play kickstarter campaigns.
